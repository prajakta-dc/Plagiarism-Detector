# Plagiarism-Detector

Building a plagiarism detector using Python

How did this project rise?
The driving idea of this project was to build a project that would allow me to apply and expand my skills on a topic that I was not trained a lot at the time: natural language processing.

The different steps of the project are listed below:

Loading and exploring the data

Building the model (feature engineering)

Training the model

What infrastructure was used?

This project relied on PyTorch and SciKit-Learn for the machine learning packages. I trained and deployed the algorithm on an AWS SageMaker notebook to discover the computational power of such instances.
